1. Pick a topic --> tornadoes

2. Find Preliminary Datasets --> See Raw Data folder on Github

    Questions we can answer with our dataset:
        What magnitude does the most damage?

        What magnitude is the most common?

        What state has the most tornados?

        Weather patterns related to tornados
            regional tornado alley vs dixie alley
            over time

        What month do the most tornados occur in?

        Width of tornado vs magnitude


3. Rudimentary EDA on Datasets

    We looked through the columns of data and decided that there are some columns that we can delete because they wont help our analysis


4. Mockup of Database

    Add the tornado, hail, wind csv to SQL as tables in a Database
    Create another table with columns from the above tables to make our dataset for analysis
    Export that table as a csv for use in our analysis in python! 

5. Mockup of the machine learning model
    predicting loss based on tornado magnitude and hail diameter(?)--> machine learning https://www.kaggle.com/code/gcdatkin/tornado-magnitude-prediction

Other Notes:
Rubric says you should have two different tables & join them together
