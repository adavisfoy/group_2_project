## Overview of Project
   - **Selected topic:**
       Tornadoes
   - **Reason why we selected our topic:**  
     - Tornados are fascinating and devasting at the same time. All members of our group are interested in this topic, especially given that we are currently experiencing spring severe weather season. 
     - Group members mostly reside in Tennesse, with one member currently living in the Midwest (who recently relocated from Memphis, TN).
     - As we began to research this topic, an **EF-3** tornado struck Andover, KS, the evening of April 29, 2022. Wind speeds reached at least 136 miles per hour with experts estimating damage to several hundred homes and businesses, including Andover's local YMCA, which sustained a direct hit. Despite the high level of destruction, only minor injuries were reported.

     - We intend to further evaluate our data and see where it takes us.
     
   - **Description of the data sources:**   
     - Our group utilized the SPC National Severe Weather Database Browser to download severe weather data including tornadoes (since 1950), as well as hail and damaging winds data (since 1955). 
       - [https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/sp3/plot.php](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/sp3/plot.php)
       - The data is derived from the National Weather Service's Storm Data publication, which is reviewed and processed by the National Climatic Data Center and the Storm Prediction Center
      
   - **Questions we hope to answer with the data:** 
   
     - Which tornado magnitude is the most common?

     - Which state has the most tornadoes?

     - In which month do the most tornadoes occur? 

     - Can we predict the number of fatalaties resulting from a tornado if we know the magnitude (EF rating) and population of the county? 
     

## Data Cleaning

## Machine Learning Models

Prior to applying either model the dataset is accessed in the database via PySpark, then converted to a Pandas df, and data types are converted to appropriate. The dataset is assigne the input and output variable then split in to training and testing data. 

1. Determine tornado's EF score based on these metrics: number of injuries, number of fatalities, loss ($), crop loss($), length (mi), and width (yds)
   - **Random Forest**                                                                          
      We started with Random Forest which returned an accuracy of 0.55625. The group decided this was too low and used the feature imporance plot to determine which features were most significant in predicting EF rating so we could apply it to a logistic regression instead.

      From this plot we determined that the Loss, Width, and Length were the top contributers to EF rating. 
       
   

   - **Logistic Regression**

The Logistic Regression returned slightly higher testing accuracy than the Random Forest Model.

2. Determine number of fatalities based on these metrics: EF rating, number of injuries, length (mi), width(yds), and county population
   - **Neural Network**  
![](https://github.com/adavisfoy/group_2_project/blob/c6fb0a799a0bda436a2c5512b566d1d6e5f55538/ML/Final%20ML%20Models/Images/NN_model.png)

The Neural Network Model testing data returned Loss: 0.9574524760246277 and Accuracy: 0.9464285969734192. 94% accuracy is too high for real world data so we decided to look into the evolution of the accuracy as the model ran. The following graphs show the loss and accuracy through each iteration (epoch) of the model. This model quickly increases accuracy (~20epochs) and converges to ~95% testing accuracy. The testing accuracy is greater than the training accuracy suggesting that the model is underfitting the data. The loss graph also suggests underfitting because loss does not decrease with increasing epochs (ie the model was unable to learn the training dataset). Overall this model is not well fit to the complexity of this dataset.

Summary: From our experience with these machine learning methods it seems that this dataset has very complicated patterns or the lack of patterns making it difficult to model. We think some of this may come from the fact that the vast majority of tornadoes in our dataset did not have any fatalities but one entry has 168 fatalites. This likely makes it very difficult to the machine learning algorithms to learn a pattern from this dataset. 


## Database:
  - Our SQL database is being remote hosted on **Amazon's AWS Relational Database Service (RDS)** free tier. 
  - Our local PostgreSQL/pgAdmin database is connected to our Amazon RDS instance. 
  - Our database include two tables: County & Tornadoes (see ERD)
  - **Entity Relationship Diagram:**
    - ERD created with **QuickDBD Web App**: [https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/)

  - Via postgreSQL, we completed a left join of population data into our tornadoes data set. 
    - We encountered a challenge with the join because the tornado population data included a year column, whereas the County (Population) data didn't include a year column but a "Pop" column (integer data for population) with the year concatenated into the column name.
    - To account for this, I created a new table within postgreSQL by duplicating the original tornado table and adding a cnty_pop (county population) column to house the joined tornado & population data.
    - The join statement utilized was not a traditional join statement, but an implied join statement using PostgreSQL's UPDATE join syntax to update the values in the new table's cnty_pop column with data from the County table. 
    - [https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-update-join/#:~:text=To%20join%20to%20another%20table,every%20row%20of%20table%20t2%20.](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-update-join/#:~:text=To%20join%20to%20another%20table,every%20row%20of%20table%20t2%20.)
    - The information was joined one year at a time into the new table to ensure that the appropriate columns were being updated. 
    - UPDATE join code example: 
```
--Join pop data into torn_pop 2010
UPDATE torn_pop
SET cnty_pop = county.pop_2010
FROM county
WHERE county.county_id = torn_pop.county_id
AND torn_pop.year = 2010;
```
  - At least one of our machine learning models will be connected to our Amazon RDS database via **Google Colaboratory**.
