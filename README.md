# Group 2 Final Project

## Week 1 
### Presentation
   - Selected topic.
       Tornados
   - Reason why they selected their topic.  
      Tornados are facinating and devasting at the same time.  
      We will look into the data to see where it takes us.
   - Description of their source of data.  
      We have downloaded data file from 
   - Questions they hope to answer with the data
      What magnitude does the most damage?

      What magnitude is the most common?

      What state has the most tornados?

      What month do the most tornados occur in?

      Width of tornado vs magnitude

### Github
  - Main Branch with a ReadMe file 
  - Description of the communication protocols
  - At least one branch for each team member w/ at least four commits from the duration of the first segment

### Machine Learning Model
Multiple Linear Regression
   - Find relationships between tornado ef scale ranking to number of injuries, fatalities, loss metrics
   - Can the model predict the ef scale based on these metrics? or vise versa?
   
  - Takes in data in from the provisional database
  - Outputs label(s) for input data

### Database notes
  - 4.29.22 - added surrogate key column ('surr_key') to each csv so we have a unique primary key for each table that we load into database.
  - [Wikipedia - Surrogate Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key) 
  - Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
  - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
